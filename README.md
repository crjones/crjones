👋 Hi, I’m Christopher.

I'm a Technologist, Agile Leader and Problem Solver available on the Internet but mostly connecting from Texas.

I specialize in building effective teams that solve complex problems.

- 🏢 I'm currently engaged with Aon/CoverWallet as a Product Owner.
- 📜 Previously I have worked with The Home Depot, Apple, Yahoo!, TaskRabbit and others.
- 🌱 I'm continuiously learning by co-hosting the [Liberators Network - United States User Group](https://github.com/theliberators/usergroups) which focuses on learning and growing together in the area of Scrum and Liberating Structures.
- 👀 I’m available for consulting, training or speaking through [One37 Consulting](https://one37.dev).
- 📫 You can reach me via [twitter](https://twitter.com/crjones) or on my [website](https://crjones.us).
- ⚡️ Fun facts: I enjoy collecting and gaming with playing cards. I also enjoy being creative in the kitchen and I'm told I make some mighty fine BBQ.
